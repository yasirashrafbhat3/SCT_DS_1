print("Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

Here we used the dataset named "population_by_age_group.xlsx" The dataset is of the year 2018. In the dataset we can find the population of each country and which is categorized by different age groups. I have used the Platform Microsoft PowerBi to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable such as Total Population by Country. As this is a large dataset I have used the Top N filter method to find the top 10 countries with their population.

Upon analysis we have found that on 2018 China is in the first place and India is on the Second place on Population.")
